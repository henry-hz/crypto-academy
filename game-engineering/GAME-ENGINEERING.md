Game Theory is not math, math is a tool for it as it's for physics.


Game Engineering in one word: Incentives

Players looking to get benefits when other players are also looking for benefit.

Why people couldn't arrive at the same deal as before the strike?  [the same for wars],
this is the Game Theory, understanding strategitc interactions.

Game engineering: Using Game Theory to design pratctical interactive systems, where all
players are looking to get benefits.

## Examples:


1. Single row at the bank.

2. Arbitration: what are the incentives that are relevants ?
How to present his position? every player will show the most radical and logic position,
once the arbitrer will divide in the middle. Game Solution: Final Offer Arbitration: every
side offer his final position, and the arbitrer will choose one of them.
